My second 1-bit sound engine. Assemble using fasmg. I use fasmg because its macro capabilities are practically required for a project with tons of SMC and dynamically relocated code like this.

See `format.asm` for song data format instructions. See `examples` for song examples. See [my youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd-hwoM2gHt1Y890qmaZwuQ) for the examples, played back and recorded with oscilloscope visualizations (Coming Soonâ„¢).
